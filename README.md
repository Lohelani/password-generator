#### _Javascript: Password Generator, 10.3.20_

### _By Lohelani Hicks_

## Description and Method

For this project I used javascript to generate a random password. The goal was to generate a password between the length of 8-128 characters(code gives error message and returns if invalid option chosen), and offer user the options of uppercase, lowercase, special characters and numbers. I created variables for all of those options, and then created a function to generate the password using those variables. Within the function, created conditional statements to enable computer to know which options were chosen. Required that the user choose at least one of those options using if statements (code will give error message and return if no otions are chosen). Used the .concat method to merge the arrays that user chose. Selections chosen are looped through a for loop with math.floor(math.random) to randomly pick the from the chosen variables at chosen length and returns a temporary password. Assignment code starts at line 57.
